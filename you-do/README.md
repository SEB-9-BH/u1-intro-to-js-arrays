Let's practice creating, modifying, and iterating over an array of strings!

1. Assign an empty array to a variable named `books`.
2. Add **'The Shining'** and **'Pride and Prejudice'** or 2 other books of your choice to the `books` array.
3. `console.log()` the second element of `books`.
4. Update the second element by assigning to it **'Dune'** or another book of your choice.
5. Iterate over the entire `books` array and `console.log()` each book string.
