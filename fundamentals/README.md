**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to create and initialize arrays using correct syntax and naming conventions.

## Creating arrays

Use array literal notation to create an array using the following syntax:

![A line of code reading: const nums = [2, 4, 18];. Elements of the code are numbered: 1) const, 2) nums, 3) the square brackets, 4) the numbers inside of the square brackets.](assets/array-syntax.png)

1. The `const` keyword. Arrays should be declared using `const`.
2. The name of the array should be plural.
3. Opening and closing square brackets indicate an array.
4. The array's elements are placed inside the square brackets. A comma separates each element, meaning the above array has been initialized with three elements. You don't have to include elements when initializing an array; use a set of empty square brackets - `[]`.

> 🏆 The name of an array should always be plural because it holds a collection of items. The array above is named `nums` because it holds numbers inside of it.

An array can hold any data inside of it (including other arrays!) and can even hold multiple data types.  

## 🎓 You Do

Create an array named `movies` containing the titles (as strings) of three of your favorite movies.

If you want your notes to match the lecture examples, use *Barbie*, *Interstellar*, and *Get Out*.
