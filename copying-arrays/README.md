**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to copy JavaScript arrays using various methods like the `spread` syntax and `slice()`, and understand when to use each method to avoid unintended side effects.

When working with arrays in JavaScript, there are scenarios where you will want to create a copy of an array rather than modifying the original one. This can prevent unintended side effects in your code, or you might want to derive a new list from the original without affecting the original.

There are multiple methods to copy an array. The method you choose will largely depend upon whether you wish to copy a segment of the array or the entire array itself.

## Copy all of an array

The [Spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) `...` is a concise way to duplicate an entire array:

Example:

```js
// as a reminder, movies is ['Barbie', 'Arrival', 'Get Out', 'Coco']

const moviesCopy = [...movies];
// movies copy is ['Barbie', 'Arrival', 'Get Out', 'Coco']
```
All elements from the `movies` array have been copied into the new array.

## Copy some of an array

The [`slice()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) method comes in handy if you want to copy just a portion of an array. This method always returns a new array and, more importantly, doesn't *mutate* the source array.

> ðŸ“š *Mutating* means directly changing a piece of data without making a separate copy. So, if you change it in one place, it changes everywhere else you're using it too.

The syntax for `slice()` is as follows:

```js
slice();
slice(start);
slice(start, end);
```

Here, the second argument is the ending index but does not include the value at that index in the result.

Example:

```js
// movies is ['Barbie', 'Arrival', 'Get Out', 'Coco']
const twoMovies = movies.slice(1);
// twoMovies is ['Arrival', 'Get Out', 'Coco']
```

## Copy an array and insert additional elements

Here's how you can copy an array and insert additional elements simultaneously using the spread syntax:

```js
const moreMovies = ['The Matrix', ...movies];
// moreMovies is ['The Matrix', 'Barbie', 'Arrival', 'Get Out', 'Coco']
```
